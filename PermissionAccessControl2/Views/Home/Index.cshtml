    This is a demo of a web application using my approach to feature and data authorization in an ASP.NET Core web application.
    It is demo of a Multi-tenant service for retail outlets which holds the stock and sales for each shop.
    It also allows managers to see what is happening in every shop that they are managing.
</p>
<p>This list of articles below describe how it works.</p>

<h2>How to use use this application</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Log in using one of the demo users <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Users" asp-action="Users">found here</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>Pick a user that has a <strong>SaleManager</strong> (good choice!) or SalesAssistant role if you want to sell something. </li>
                <li>Pick a user that has a AreaManger if you want to see data for all shops. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you have logged in then a menu should have a "Shop" dropdown - pick one of the following.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Till</strong> to sell something (not present if AreaManager).</li>
                <li><strong>Stock</strong> to see what stock the shop has.</li>
                <li><strong>Sales</strong> to see what sales the shop has done (not present if SalesAssistant).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When log in you can see your claims, permissions and other user/role ifo via the "Users" menu button.</li>
        <li>Also look at <a asp-area="" asp-controller="Company" asp-action="Index">Company/Outlets</a> for a list of the hierarchical data.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
